# NekoIOLabs-Tcp-Communication
## General Info

This is a liberary i made so that people don't have to rewrite common tcp communications. This liberary has a genreal implementation of a Tcp Server and client.
Through the IProtocolParser interface you are able to add any Kind of protocol and get the parsed messages back from the liberary. As Standard ill release the Liberary with
Websocket Support since there is no good websocket server provided for .net core outside of asp.net as far as i know.
